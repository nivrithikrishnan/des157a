        <p>Article: <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a></p>
        <br>
        <p> This article covers how to analyze visuals more closely through the lens of ten rather unusual photographs. In summary, the ability to notice small details, making connections, and asking questions about any piece of art or literature is a skill that requires practice. Consistently and intentionally looking closer at these pieces, asking open-ended questions, starting conversations with others, and building upon existing ideas can all be ways of sparking curiosity and understanding. I thought the concept of teaching close reading through 'What's Going On?' pictures was quite smart. Often times when I look at these visuals, it does require some degree of close observation and drawing connections based on the given context and outside knowledge to piece what the true story behind the picture is. One website I found that uses imagery in an interesting way is <a href="https://thenaijastory.check-dc.com/entertainment">The Naija Story</a>(animations with multiple images & collages), <a href="https://water.falmec.com/en/">Water (Falmec)</a>(subtle animations with images), and <a href="https://livingcorporate.workshopbuilt.com/">Living Corporate</a>(background imagery)</p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> covers the definition, usage, and general tips for implementing modal windows into a design. As stated in the article, "A modal window is an element that sits on top of an applicationâ€™s main window." It's design essentially forces users to view content first before, returning or viewing its parent application. It is commonly used to grab the users attention, when user-input is required (ex: sign up or log in form), and displaying additional information (both in and out of context) (ex: larger images & videos, notifications (not errors/success/warnings!)). </p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/modal.webp" alt="Anatomy of Modal Window" width="50%">
        <p>Some important elements to incorporate into the design of a modal window include having an escape hatch (escape key), descriptive title, actionable and understandable buttons, appropriate sizing and location, focus (often through a lightbox effect), be user-initiated, and work effectively in a mobile view. For the last point, it is important to note that modals and mobile devices often don't work well together. Therefore, this would require adding additional elements like a keyboard, nested scroll bars and zoom-in and zoom-out features. Preferably though, these should be avoided. </p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> highlights twenty key points one should address when designing a form to increase its usability. While there were some practices listed I found self-explanatory, there were a handful that stood out and I plan to implement on future designs. One of these included the formatting requirements. Positioning a label above the text boxes and to the left, was a standard practice I often overlooked. In addition, displaying any placeholder text below the text boxes rather than in them, prevents the user from having to go back and forth, typing and deleting the input after the hints disappear. Another shocking one was avoiding a reset or clear button, something I intitially thought would be helpful but now realize may do more harm than good. The last point, also covered some strong accessibility suggestions liek allowing users to control the text size, ensuring proper contrast, and not relying on visual cues to communicate the status of the form. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A good example of a website form: <a href="https://www.apple.com/contact/feedback/">Apple Feedback Form</a></p>
        <p>I thought apple reflected strong deisng practices in their form design, including visual and textual cues, strong contrasting colors, clear feedback, and an overall clean design. The form itself also included only the most necessary information, was organized in a single column, allowed for an expandable box for the comments.</p>
