        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> highlights twenty key points one should address when designing a form to increase its usability. While there were some practices listed I found self-explanatory, there were a handful that stood out and I plan to implement on future designs. One of these included the formatting requirements. Positioning a label above the text boxes and to the left, was a standard practice I often overlooked. In addition, displaying any placeholder text below the text boxes rather than in them, prevents the user from having to go back and forth, typing and deleting the input after the hints disappear. Another shocking one was avoiding a reset or clear button, something I intitially thought would be helpful but now realize may do more harm than good. The last point, also covered some strong accessibility suggestions liek allowing users to control the text size, ensuring proper contrast, and not relying on visual cues to communicate the status of the form. </p>

        <p>A good example of a website form: <a href="https://www.apple.com/contact/feedback/">Apple Feedback Form</a></p>
        <p>I thought apple reflected strong deisng practices in their form design, including visual and textual cues, strong contrasting colors, clear feedback, and an overall clean design. The form itself also included only the most necessary information, was organized in a single column, allowed for an expandable box for the comments.</p>
