        <p>Article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>The article selected was written by Amir Dori, an experiened game designer and the importance of UX research in his work. Here are some of my biggest takeaways. If your game includes sliders, make sure the content remains partly visible on the screen so users know there is more to be seen. If a pop-up contains valuable content, use a "close" button rather than an "X" to increase the probability of them reading the information rather than closing the pop-up instantly. Positive user decisions should be placed on the right side of the game (ex: purchases, sharing content, not cancelling). I also thought the concept of dark-UX was interesting. The idea is essentially when designers create experiences the benefit the interests of the company rather than the user. While in most scenarios they are to be avoided, the author did mention in some sections how some dark UX patterns actually benefit the user (ex: continuity of the game). While it is clear they do intentionally manipulate users into certain actions, it made me think if there were any other times when some "Dark UX" patterns are actually acceptable. </p>

                <p>The image I selected is from a recent trip to London of the London Eye. It was taken from a ferry as we did not visit the attraction itself. It relates to be collection as all the images I selected for this project are from this trip. It says something about me because they are pictures that I took while visiting. </p>

            <div class="split-2">
                <p>The image appears to be of a museum exhbit with a range of paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and other artifacts presented. The most interesting about the image to me is all of the detail in each of the pieces. Each painting and item appear to hold a lot of value and hold a different story. The mystery of the image is understanding what exactly is being shown, where the artifacts are from and their culture and history. Based on my first impression, because it is difficult to pinpoint what exactly the image is of to begin with, the image as a whole sparks the viewer;s curiosity. </p>

        <p>Article: <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a></p>
        <br>
        <p> This article covers how to analyze visuals more closely through the lens of ten rather unusual photographs. In summary, the ability to notice small details, making connections, and asking questions about any piece of art or literature is a skill that requires practice. Consistently and intentionally looking closer at these pieces, asking open-ended questions, starting conversations with others, and building upon existing ideas can all be ways of sparking curiosity and understanding. I thought the concept of teaching close reading through 'What's Going On?' pictures was quite smart. Often times when I look at these visuals, it does require some degree of close observation and drawing connections based on the given context and outside knowledge to piece what the true story behind the picture is. One website I found that uses imagery in an interesting way is <a href="https://thenaijastory.check-dc.com/entertainment">The Naija Story</a>(animations with multiple images & collages), <a href="https://water.falmec.com/en/">Water (Falmec)</a>(subtle animations with images), and <a href="https://livingcorporate.workshopbuilt.com/">Living Corporate</a>(background imagery)</p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> covers the definition, usage, and general tips for implementing modal windows into a design. As stated in the article, "A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window." It's design essentially forces users to view content first before, returning or viewing its parent application. It is commonly used to grab the users attention, when user-input is required (ex: sign up or log in form), and displaying additional information (both in and out of context) (ex: larger images & videos, notifications (not errors/success/warnings!)). </p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/modal.webp" alt="Anatomy of Modal Window" width="50%">
        <p>Some important elements to incorporate into the design of a modal window include having an escape hatch (escape key), descriptive title, actionable and understandable buttons, appropriate sizing and location, focus (often through a lightbox effect), be user-initiated, and work effectively in a mobile view. For the last point, it is important to note that modals and mobile devices often don't work well together. Therefore, this would require adding additional elements like a keyboard, nested scroll bars and zoom-in and zoom-out features. Preferably though, these should be avoided. </p>

        <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> highlights twenty key points one should address when designing a form to increase its usability. While there were some practices listed I found self-explanatory, there were a handful that stood out and I plan to implement on future designs. One of these included the formatting requirements. Positioning a label above the text boxes and to the left, was a standard practice I often overlooked. In addition, displaying any placeholder text below the text boxes rather than in them, prevents the user from having to go back and forth, typing and deleting the input after the hints disappear. Another shocking one was avoiding a reset or clear button, something I intitially thought would be helpful but now realize may do more harm than good. The last point, also covered some strong accessibility suggestions liek allowing users to control the text size, ensuring proper contrast, and not relying on visual cues to communicate the status of the form. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A good example of a website form: <a href="https://www.apple.com/contact/feedback/">Apple Feedback Form</a></p>
        <p>I thought apple reflected strong deisng practices in their form design, including visual and textual cues, strong contrasting colors, clear feedback, and an overall clean design. The form itself also included only the most necessary information, was organized in a single column, allowed for an expandable box for the comments.</p>
